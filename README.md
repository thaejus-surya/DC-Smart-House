# DC-Smart-House
System Engineering Project

AC energy sources are less efficient due to conversion losses. Energy produced from fossil fuels may give rise to  high and unstable energy prices and global climate change. Therefore, a self-sustaining neighborhood of  financially viable smart DC apartment buildings, optimized with complementary renewable energy solutions is developed to tackle this problem
