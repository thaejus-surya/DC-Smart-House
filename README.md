# DC-Smart-House
System Engineering Project

AC energy sources are less efficient due to conversion losses. Energy produced from fossil fuels may give rise to  high and unstable energy prices and global climate change. Therefore, a self-sustaining neighborhood of  financially viable smart DC apartment buildings, optimized with complementary renewable energy solutions is developed to tackle this problem.

A Python programme is developed to simulate energy production using solar, wind, and tidal sources in Perth, Australia. A DC-powered house with a full load requirement is calculated for each month and the number of solar panels, wind turbines, and tidal plants are calculated.
